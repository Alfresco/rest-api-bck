Also, as requesting rendition is a background process,\nany rendition failure (e.g. No transformer is currently available) will not fail the whole upload and has the potential to silently fail.\n\nUse **overwrite** to overwrite an existing file, matched by name. If the file is versionable,\nthe existing content is replaced.\n\nWhen you overwrite existing content, you can set the **majorVersion** boolean field to **true** to indicate a major version\nshould be created. The default for **majorVersion** is **false**.\nSetting  **majorVersion** enables versioning of the node, if it is not already versioned.\n\nWhen you overwrite existing content, you can use the **comment** field to add a version comment that appears in the\nversion history. This also enables versioning of this node, if it is not already versioned.\n\nYou can set the **autoRename** boolean field to automatically resolve name clashes. If there is a name clash, then\nthe API method tries to create\na unique name using an integer suffix.\n   \nAny field in the JSON body defined below can also be passed as a form-data field.\n\nThis API method also supports node creation using application/json.\n\nYou must specify at least a **name** and **nodeType**. For example, to create a folder:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\":\"My Folder\",\n  \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can create an empty file like this:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\":\"My text file.txt\",\n  \"nodeType\":\"cm:content\"\n}\n```\nYou can update binary content using the ```PUT /nodes/{nodeId}``` API method.\n\nYou can create a folder, or other node, inside a folder hierarchy:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\":\"My Special Folder\",\n  \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",\n  \"relativePath\":\"X/Y/Z\"\n}\n```\nThe **relativePath** specifies the folder structure to create relative to the node **nodeId**. Folders in the\n**relativePath** that do not exist are created before the node is created.\n\nYou can set properties when you create a new node:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\":\"My Other Folder\",\n  \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",\n  \"properties\":\n    {\n      \"cm:title\":\"Folder title\",\n      \"cm:description\":\"This is an important folder\"\n    }\n}\n```\nAny missing aspects are applied automatically. For example, **cm:titled** in the JSON shown above. You can set aspects\nexplicitly, if needed, using an **aspectNames** field.\n\nTypically, for files and folders, the primary children are created within the parent folder using the default \"cm:contains\" assocType. \nIf the content model allows then it is also possible to create primary children with a different assoc type. For example:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\":\"My Node\",\n  \"nodeType\":\"my:specialNodeType\",\n  \"association\":\n    {\n      \"assocType\":\"my:specialAssocType\"\n    }\n}\n``` \n\nAdditional associations can be added after creating a node. You can also add associations at the time the node is created. This is \nrequired, for example, if the content model specifies that a node has mandatory associations to one or more existing nodes. You can optionally \nspecify an array of **secondaryChildren** to create one or more secondary child associations, such that the newly created node acts as a parent node. \nYou can optionally specify an array of **targets** to create one or more peer associations such that the newly created node acts as a source node. \nFor example, to associate one or more secondary children at time of creation:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\":\"My Folder\",\n  \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",\n  \"secondaryChildren\":\n    [ {\"childId\":\"abcde-01234-...\", \"assocType\":\"my:specialChildAssocType\"} ]\n}\n``` \nFor example, to associate one or more targets at time of creation:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"name\":\"My Folder\",\n  \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\",\n  \"targets\":\n    [ {\"targetId\":\"abcde-01234-...\", \"assocType\":\"my:specialPeerAssocType\"} ]\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** You can create more than one child by \nspecifying a list of nodes in the JSON body. For example, the following JSON\nbody creates two folders inside the specified **nodeId**, if the **nodeId** identifies\na folder:\n\n```JSON\n[\n  {\n    \"name\":\"My Folder 1\",\n    \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\":\"My Folder 2\",\n    \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\"\n  }\n]\n```\nIf you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body. For example:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"list\": {\n    \"pagination\": {\n      \"count\": 2,\n      \"hasMoreItems\": false,\n      \"totalItems\": 2,\n      \"skipCount\": 0,\n      \"maxItems\": 100\n    },\n    \"entries\": [\n      {\n        \"entry\": {\n          ...\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"entry\": {\n          ...\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n","operationId":"createNode","consumes":["application/json","multipart/form-data"],"produces":["application/json"],"parameters":[{"name":"nodeId","in":"path","description":"The identifier of a node.
